            An FD is a term deposit where you agree to keep your money with the bank or financial
            institution for a specific duration (e.g., 1 month to 10 years). The interest rate on an FD
            depends on the deposit amount, the tenure (length of time), and the specific bank or
            institution. There are various types of FDs, including those with monthly or quarterly interest
            payouts, tax-saving FDs, and those with special rates for senior citizens.
            Maximise the potential of your hard-earned money. Fixed Deposits offer attractive interest
            rates and flexible tenure options to grow your wealth over time.

            Bonds are a type of debt instrument, meaning they represent a loan from the bondholder to
            the issuer. The issuer of a bond can be a government (federal, state, or local) or a
            corporation. Bonds are considered fixed-income securities because the interest payments
            are typically predetermined.
