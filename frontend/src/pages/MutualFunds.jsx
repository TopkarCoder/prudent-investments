      ` Investors may not have the time or the required knowledge and
        resources to conduct their research and purchase individual stocks or bonds. A mutual fund is
        managed by full-time, professional money managers who have the expertise, experience and
        resources to actively buy, sell, and monitor investments. A fund manager continuously monitors
        investments and rebalances the portfolio accordingly to meet the scheme‚Äôs objectives. Portfolio
        management by professional fund managers is one of the most important advantages of a mutual
        fund.`

    description:
      ` Buying shares in a mutual fund is an easy way to diversify your investments
        across many securities and asset categories such as equity, debt and gold, which helps in spreading
        the risk - so you won't have all your eggs in one basket. This proves to be beneficial when an
        underlying security of a given mutual fund scheme experiences market headwinds. With
        diversification, the risk associated with one asset class is countered by the others. Thus, risk
        diversification is one of the most prominent advantages of investing in mutual funds.`,

        costly to directly purchase all of the individual securities held by a single mutual fund. By contrast,
        the minimum initial investments for most mutual funds are more affordable.`,

    description:
      ` You can easily redeem (liquidate) units of open ended mutual fund schemes to meet
        your financial needs on any business day (when the stock markets and/or banks are open), so you
        have easy access to your money. Upon redemption, the redemption amount is credited in your bank
        account within one day to 3-4 days, depending upon the type of scheme`,

                A Systematic Investment Plan (SIP), more popularly known as SIP, is a facility offered by mutual funds
                to the investors to invest in a disciplined manner. SIP facility allows an investor to invest a fixed
                amount of money at pre-defined intervals in the selected mutual fund scheme. The fixed amount of
                money can be as low as Rs. 500, while the pre-defined SIP intervals can be on a
                weekly/monthly/quarterly/semi-annually or annual basis. By taking the SIP route to investments, the
                investor invests in a time-bound manner without worrying about the market dynamics and stands to
                benefit in the long-term due to average costing and power of compounding.
