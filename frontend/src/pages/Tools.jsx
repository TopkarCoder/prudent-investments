        '<p>This fundamental principle of the rule is to have a seven year investment horizon . Historic data shows that equities have performed well in the longer horizon and investing via SIP allows the power of compounding to take full effect. The longer the investment horizon the more significant is the compounding effect. Investing in equity SIPs for a minimum of 7 years significantly improves the likelihood of achieving reasonable returns while also lowering the chances of experiencing negative returns.</p>',

The 5 finger framework suggests spreading investments across five asset classes to balance risk and reward. These asset classes include high-quality stocks, value stocks, growth at reasonable price (GARP) stocks, mid-or-small cap stocks, and global stocks</p>',

      ` <p>Equity investors often face three challenging phases that test their commitment. Here is how to prepare:</p>
        <p><strong>The Disappointment Phase (7‚Äì10% returns):</strong> Investors may anticipate high returns and feel let down by moderate gains. Recognizing that even moderate returns signify progress helps manage expectations.</p>
        <p><strong>The Irritation Phase (0‚Äì7% returns):</strong> Investors might get frustrated, thinking fixed deposits would‚Äôve done better. But SIPs are meant for long-term wealth, not short-term comparisons.</p>
        <p><strong>The Panic Phase (Negative returns):</strong> A drop in value below initial investment can trigger panic. But staying composed and continuing SIPs helps benefit from market recovery.</p>

      description:
        `<p>Increasing your SIP amount each year is like boosting the strength of your equity portfolio. It reflects
        a stronger commitment toward your financial goals and can help improve long-term outcomes.
        Understand why this strategy matters:</p>
        <p><strong>Reach your financial goals faster</strong> - Raising your SIP amount over time can speed up the achievement
        of your financial targets</p>
        <p><strong>Expanding financial goals</strong> - With experiencing the benefits of incremental growth, the financial
        aspirations may expand. One might start considering financial independence as a goal rather than
        solely focussing on building a retirement corpus.</p`
